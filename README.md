## Implementation
### Time-Step Adaptation 
This particle swarm optimizers uses the mean absolute deviation of particle position as an adjustment to the time step, to prevent the particle overshoot problem.  This particle distribution is initialized to one when the swarm starts, so that the impact is boundary independent. 

### Constraint Handling
Users must create their own constraint function for their problems, if there are constraints beyond the problem bounds.  This is then passed into the constructor. If the default constraint function is used, it always returns true (which means there are no constraints).

### Boundary Types
This PSO optimizers has 4 different types of bounds, Random (Particles that leave the area respawn), Reflection (Particles that hit the bounds reflect), Absorb (Particles that hit the bounds lose velocity in that direction), Invisible (Out of bound particles are no longer evaluated).

Some updates have not incorporated appropriate handling for all boundary conditions.  This bug is known and is being worked on.  The most consistent boundary type at the moment is Random.  If constraints are violated, but bounds are not, currently random bound rules are used to deal with this problem. 

### Multi-Object Optimization
The no preference method of multi-objective optimization, but a Pareto Front is not calculated. Instead the best choice (smallest norm of output vectors) is listed as the output.

### Objective Function Handling
The optimizer minimizes the absolute value of the difference from the target outputs and the evaluated outputs.  Future versions may include options for function minimization absent target values. 

## Example Implementations

### Basic PSO Example
pso_test.py provides a sample use case of the optimizer. 

### Detailed Messages
pso_test_details.py provides an example using a parent class, and the self.suppress_output and detailedWarnings flags to control error messages that are passed back to the parent class to be printed with a timestamp. This implementation sets up the hooks for integration with AntennaCAT in order to provide the user feedback of warnings and errors.

### Realtime Graph

pso_test_graph.py provides an example using a parent class, and the self.suppress_output and detailedWarnings flags to control error messages that are passed back to the parent class to be printed with a timestamp. Additionally, a realtime graph shows particle locations at every step.

NOTE: if you close the graph as the code is running, the code will continue to run, but the graph will not re-open.
